Yatai (Â±ãÂè∞, food cart) lets you deploy, operate and scale Machine Learning services on Kubernetes. 

It supports deploying any ML models via [BentoML: the unified model serving framework](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml).

## Why Yatai?

üç± Made for BentoML, deploy at scale

- Scale [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml) to its full potential on a distributed system, optimized for cost saving and performance.
- Manage deployment lifecycle to deploy, update, or rollback via API or Web UI.
- Centralized registry providing the **foundation for CI/CD** via artifact management APIs, labeling, and WebHooks for custom integration.

üöÖ Cloud native & DevOps friendly

- Kubernetes-native workflow via [BentoDeployment CRD](https://docs.bentoml.org/projects/yatai/en/latest/concepts/bentodeployment_crd.html) (Custom Resource Definition), which can easily fit into an existing GitOps workflow.
- Native [integration with Grafana](https://docs.bentoml.org/projects/yatai/en/latest/observability/metrics.html) stack for observability.
- Support for traffic control with Istio.
- Compatible with all major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, and GCP).

## Quick Tour

Let's try out Yatai locally in a minikube cluster!

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites:
  * Install latest minikube: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
  * Install latest Helm: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/
  * Start a minikube Kubernetes cluster: `minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 4096`
  * Check that minikube cluster status is "running": `minikube status`
  * Make sure your `kubectl` is configured with `minikube` context: `kubectl config current-context`
  * Enable ingress controller: `minikube addons enable ingress`

### üöß Install Yatai

Install Yatai with the following script:

```bash
DEVEL=true bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bentoml/yatai/main/scripts/quick-install-yatai.sh")
```

This script will install Yatai along with its dependencies (PostgreSQL and MinIO) on
your minikube cluster. 

Note that this installation script is made for development and testing use only.
For production deployment, check out the [Installation Guide](https://docs.bentoml.org/projects/yatai/en/latest/installation/index.html).

To access Yatai web UI, run the following command and keep the terminal open:

```bash
kubectl --namespace yatai-system port-forward svc/yatai 8080:80
```

In a separate terminal, run:

```bash
YATAI_INITIALIZATION_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret env --namespace yatai-system -o jsonpath="{.data.YATAI_INITIALIZATION_TOKEN}" | base64 --decode)
echo "Open in browser: http://127.0.0.1:8080/setup?token=$YATAI_INITIALIZATION_TOKEN"
``` 

Open the URL printed above from your browser to finish admin account setup.


### üç± Push Bento to Yatai

First, get an API token and login to the BentoML CLI:

* Keep the `kubectl port-forward` command in the step above running
* Go to Yatai's API tokens page: http://127.0.0.1:8080/api_tokens
* Create a new API token from the UI, making sure to assign "API" access under "Scopes"
* Copy the login command upon token creation and run as a shell command, e.g.:

    ```bash
    bentoml yatai login --api-token {YOUR_TOKEN} --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ```

If you don't already have a Bento built, run the following commands from the [BentoML Quickstart Project](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/tree/main/examples/quickstart) to build a sample Bento:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml.git && cd ./examples/quickstart
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
python train.py
bentoml build
```

Push your newly built Bento to Yatai:

```bash
bentoml push iris_classifier:latest
```

Now you can view and manage models and bentos from the web UI:

<img width="785" alt="yatai-model-detail" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/489344/151456021-360a6d6e-acb8-494b-9f6b-868ef9d13bce.png">

### üîß Install yatai-deployment component

Yatai's Deployment feature comes as a separate component, you can install it via the following
script:

```bash
DEVEL=true bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bentoml/yatai-deployment/main/scripts/quick-install-yatai-deployment.sh")
```

This will install the `BentoDeployment` CRD([Custom Resource Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/))
in your cluster and enable the deployment UI on Yatai. Similarly, this script is made for development and testing purposes only.

### üö¢ Deploy Bento!

Once the `yatai-deployment` component was installed, Bentos pushed to Yatai can be deployed to your 
Kubernetes cluster and exposed via a Service endpoint. 

A Bento Deployment can be created either via Web UI or via a Kubernetes CRD config:

#### Option 1. Simple Deployment via Web UI

* Go to the deployments page: http://127.0.0.1:8080/deployments
* Click `Create` button and follow the instructions on the UI

<img width="785" alt="yatai-deployment-creation" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/489344/151456002-d4e9f84d-8a71-4bf9-bde7-f94a74abbf3f.png">

#### Option 2. Deploy with kubectl & CRD

Define your Bento deployment in a `my_deployment.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.yatai.ai/v1alpha3
kind: BentoDeployment
metadata:
    name: my-bento-deployment
    namespace: yatai
spec:
    bento_tag: iris_classifier:3oevmqfvnkvwvuqj
    ingress:
        enabled: true
    resources:
        limits:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "512m"
        requests:
            cpu: "250m"
            memory: "128m"
    autoscaling:
        max_replicas: 10
        min_replicas: 2
    runners:
        - name: iris_clf
          resources:
              limits:
                  cpu: "1000m"
                  memory: "1Gi"
              requests:
                  cpu: "500m"
                  memory: "512m"
              autoscaling:
                  max_replicas: 4
                  min_replicas: 1
```

Apply the deployment to your minikube cluster:
```bash
kubectl apply -f my_deployment.yaml
```

Now you can see the deployment process from the Yatai Web UI and find the endpoint URL for accessing
the deployed Bento.
