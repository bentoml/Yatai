# Yatai Helm Chart

The Yatai Helm Chart is the official way to operate Yatai on Kubernetes. It contains all the required components to get started, and can configure with external services base on needs.

See the [Yatai administrator's guide](https://github.com/bentoml/Yatai/blob/main/docs/admin-guide.md) for how to install Yatai and other information on charts, and advanced configuration.

Advantage of using Yatai Helm chart:

* Easy to deploy, upgrade, and maintain Yatai service on Kubernetes cluster
* Easy to configure with external services
* Up to date with the latest Yatai release


## TL;DR:

```bash
helm repo add bentoml https://bentoml.github.io/charts
helm repo update
kubectl create ns yatai-system
helm install yatai bentoml/yatai -n yatai-system
```

## Helm chart deployment overview

This chart will create the following resources on Kubernetes:
1. Yatai service under the `yatai-system` namespace.
2. service account (if not configured).
