Chart version and appVersions

- chart version is the version of the chart itself. (It's the `version` field in the `Chart.yaml` file.)
- appVersion is the version of the application contained in the chart. (It's the `appVersion` field in the `Chart.yaml` file.)

Since Yatai chart and templates don't change often. We will use the same version
for both `version` and `appVersion`.
