`Yatai(Â±ãÂè∞, food cart) <https://github.com/bentoml/Yatai>`_ lets you deploy, operate and scale Machine Learning services on Kubernetes.

It supports deploying any ML models via `BentoML <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML>`_, the unified model serving framework.


Why Yatai?
----------

üç± Made for BentoML, deploy at scale

- Scale `BentoML <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML>`_ to its full potential on a distributed system, optimized for cost saving and performance.
- Manage deployment lifecycle to deploy, update, or roll back via API or Web UI.
- Centralized registry providing the **foundation for CI/CD** via artifact management APIs, labeling, and WebHooks for custom integration.

üöÖ Cloud native & DevOps friendly

- Kubernetes-native workflow via :doc:`BentoDeployment CRD <concepts/bentodeployment_crd>` (Custom Resource Definition), which can easily fit into an existing GitOps workflow.
- Native :doc:`integration with Grafana <observability/metrics>` stack for observability.
- Support for traffic control with Istio.
- Compatible with all major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, and GCP).
