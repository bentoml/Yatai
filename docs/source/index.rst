What is Yatai?
----------------
`Yatai <https://github.com/bentoml/Yatai>`_ is a production-first platform for your machine learning needs. It brings collaborative `BentoML <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML>`_ workflows to Kubernetes, helps ML teams to run model serving at scale, while simplifying model management and deployment across teams.

Why Yatai?
----------------

* Yatai accelerates the process of taking ML models from training stage to production and reduces the operational overhead of running a reliable model serving system.

* Yatai simplifies collaboration between Data Science and Engineering teams. It is designed to leverage the BentoML standard and streamline production ML workflows.

* Yatai is a cloud native platform with a wide range of integrations to best fit your infrastructure needs, and it is easily customizable for your CI/CD needs.
